# üöÄ ChromR Visualization & Performance Roadmap

This roadmap focuses on improving **performance, scalability, and visualization** for chromR genomic plots.

---

## ‚ö° Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Support for very large genomes
  - [ ] Optimize reading of GFF and auxiliary files (read only necessary columns)
  - [ ] Early filtering of irrelevant contigs or features
- [ ] Sampling options
  - [ ] Implement feature/contig sampling to avoid plot saturation
  - [ ] Allow user-defined sampling thresholds or automatic detection
- [ ] Parallel processing
  - [ ] Use parallelization for data processing on multi-core machines
  - [ ] Benchmark performance with large datasets

---

## üé® Visualization Improvements
- [ ] Interactive plots
  - [x] Implement Plotly or equivalent for HTML interactive plots
  - [ ] Add hover info: gene name, feature type, position, etc.
- [ ] Chromosome scaling
  - [ ] Automatic scale adjustment for contigs of very different lengths
  - [ ] Ensure small contigs remain visible while maintaining relative positions
- [ ] Labeling enhancements
  - [ ] Rotate or adjust chromosome labels for long names
  - [ ] Optional zoom-in/out or focus on selected chromosomes
- [ ] Plot aesthetics
  - [ ] Support custom color palettes and themes
  - [ ] Different shapes or symbols for feature types (genes, pseudogenes, domains)

---

## üìä Advanced Plots
- [x] Accumulated/cumulative distribution plots
  - [ ] Show normalized distribution across chromosomes
  - [ ] Allow overlay of multiple categories or keywords
- [ ] Multi-layer plots
  - [ ] Combine different feature types in a single plot
  - [ ] Interactive filtering to toggle categories on/off

---

## üìù Notes
- Consider adding **documentation examples** showing large genome datasets and interactive plots.
- Include **sample datasets** for users to test performance and visualization features.
